# SLOs & DORA Metrics Mapping

FlakeGuard implements comprehensive Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and maps to DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics to ensure reliable operation and continuous improvement of development velocity.

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### System Availability SLOs

#### API Availability
- **Target**: 99.9% uptime (8.77 hours downtime/year)
- **Measurement Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 43.2 minutes/month

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Availability Measurement"
        HEALTH[Health Checks]
        UPTIME[Uptime Monitoring]
        LATENCY[Response Time]
        ERRORS[Error Rate]
    end
    
    subgraph "SLO Tracking"
        SLI[Service Level Indicators]
        BUDGET[Error Budget]
        ALERTS[SLO Alerts]
    end
    
    subgraph "Actions"
        INCIDENT[Incident Response]
        IMPROVE[Reliability Improvements]
        POSTMORTEM[Post-Incident Review]
    end
    
    HEALTH --> SLI
    UPTIME --> SLI
    LATENCY --> SLI
    ERRORS --> SLI
    
    SLI --> BUDGET
    SLI --> ALERTS
    
    ALERTS --> INCIDENT
    BUDGET --> IMPROVE
    INCIDENT --> POSTMORTEM
```

#### Webhook Processing SLOs
- **Target**: 99.95% successful webhook processing
- **Maximum Processing Time**: 95th percentile < 2 seconds
- **Queue Processing**: 99% of jobs processed within 5 minutes

```prometheus
# Availability SLI
(
  sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[5m])) /
  sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
) * 100

# Latency SLI  
histogram_quantile(0.95, 
  sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)
) < 2
```

### Performance SLOs

#### Response Time Targets

## DORA Metrics Integration

FlakeGuard directly impacts and measures all four key DORA metrics:

### 1. Lead Time for Changes

**Definition**: Time from code commit to production deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Lead Time Measurement"
        COMMIT[Code Commit]
        PR[Pull Request]
        CI[CI Pipeline]
        FLAKE[FlakeGuard Analysis]
        DEPLOY[Deployment]
    end
    
    COMMIT --> PR
    PR --> CI
    CI --> FLAKE
    FLAKE --> DEPLOY
    
    COMMIT -.->|Lead Time| DEPLOY
```

**FlakeGuard Impact:**
- **Reduces lead time** by identifying flaky tests early
- **Prevents delays** caused by false positive test failures
- **Improves confidence** in automated deployments

**Measurement:**
```sql
-- Average lead time calculation
SELECT 
  AVG(
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (deployment_time - commit_time)) / 3600
  ) as avg_lead_time_hours,
  DATE_TRUNC('week', deployment_time) as week
FROM deployments d
JOIN commits c ON d.commit_sha = c.sha
WHERE deployment_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```

**Target**: < 2 hours for critical fixes, < 1 day for features

### 2. Deployment Frequency

**Definition**: How often code is deployed to production

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Deployment Pipeline"
        TRIGGER[Deployment Trigger]
        FLAKE_CHECK[FlakeGuard Pre-Deploy Check]
        QUALITY_GATE[Quality Gate]
        DEPLOY[Production Deploy]
    end
    
    subgraph "FlakeGuard Contribution"
        FLAKE_SCORE[Flakiness Score]
        QUARANTINE[Quarantine Status]
        CONFIDENCE[Confidence Level]
    end
    
    TRIGGER --> FLAKE_CHECK
    FLAKE_CHECK --> QUALITY_GATE
    QUALITY_GATE --> DEPLOY
    
    FLAKE_CHECK --> FLAKE_SCORE
    FLAKE_CHECK --> QUARANTINE
    FLAKE_CHECK --> CONFIDENCE
```

**FlakeGuard Impact:**
- **Enables frequent deployments** by reducing test-related blockers
- **Improves deployment confidence** through flakiness insights
- **Reduces manual intervention** in CI/CD pipelines

**Measurement:**
```sql
-- Deployment frequency
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as deployments_per_week,
  DATE_TRUNC('week', deployment_time) as week
FROM deployments 
WHERE deployment_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
  AND status = 'success'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```

**Target**: Multiple deployments per day

### 3. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)

**Definition**: Average time to recover from failures

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Recovery Process"
        INCIDENT[Incident Detection]
        DIAGNOSIS[Root Cause Analysis]
        FIX[Fix Implementation]
        RECOVERY[Service Recovery]
    end
    
    subgraph "FlakeGuard Assistance"
        FLAKE_DATA[Flakiness History]
        PATTERN[Failure Patterns]
        INSIGHTS[Actionable Insights]
    end
    
    INCIDENT --> DIAGNOSIS
    DIAGNOSIS --> FIX
    FIX --> RECOVERY
    
    DIAGNOSIS --> FLAKE_DATA
    DIAGNOSIS --> PATTERN
    DIAGNOSIS --> INSIGHTS
```

**FlakeGuard Impact:**
- **Faster diagnosis** by distinguishing real failures from flaky tests
- **Reduced false alarms** leading to faster genuine issue resolution
- **Historical context** for pattern-based troubleshooting

**Measurement:**
```sql
-- Mean Time to Recovery
SELECT 
  AVG(
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_time - detected_time)) / 60
  ) as mttr_minutes,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', detected_time) as month
FROM incidents i
WHERE detected_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
  AND status = 'resolved'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

**Target**: < 1 hour for critical issues, < 4 hours for major issues

### 4. Change Failure Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of deployments causing production failures

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Change Quality Assessment"
        DEPLOY[Deployment]
        MONITOR[Monitoring]
        FAILURE[Failure Detection]
        ANALYSIS[Failure Analysis]
    end
    
    subgraph "FlakeGuard Prevention"
        PRE_DEPLOY[Pre-deployment Check]
        FLAKE_FILTER[Flaky Test Filtering]
        QUALITY[Quality Signals]
        CONFIDENCE[Deployment Confidence]
    end
    
    DEPLOY --> MONITOR
    MONITOR --> FAILURE
    FAILURE --> ANALYSIS
    
    PRE_DEPLOY --> DEPLOY
    FLAKE_FILTER --> PRE_DEPLOY
    QUALITY --> PRE_DEPLOY
    CONFIDENCE --> PRE_DEPLOY
```

**FlakeGuard Impact:**
- **Prevents false positive failures** from affecting deployment decisions
- **Improves test signal quality** for better change validation
- **Reduces rollbacks** caused by flaky test false alarms

**Measurement:**
```sql
-- Change failure rate
SELECT 
  (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE caused_failure = true))::float / 
  COUNT(*) * 100 as failure_rate_percent,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', deployment_time) as month
FROM deployments
WHERE deployment_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

**Target**: < 15% change failure rate

## FlakeGuard-Specific Metrics

### Flakiness Detection Metrics

#### Detection Accuracy
```prometheus
# Flakiness detection precision
(
  flakeguard_true_positives / 
  (flakeguard_true_positives + flakeguard_false_positives)
) * 100

# Flakiness detection recall  
(
  flakeguard_true_positives /
  (flakeguard_true_positives + flakeguard_false_negatives)
) * 100
```

**Targets:**
- **Precision**: > 95% (minimize false positives)
- **Recall**: > 90% (catch most flaky tests)
- **F1 Score**: > 92% (balanced precision and recall)

#### Test Suite Health Metrics

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Test Suite Metrics"
        TOTAL[Total Tests]
        FLAKY[Flaky Tests]
        QUARANTINED[Quarantined Tests]
        STABLE[Stable Tests]
    end
    
    subgraph "Health Indicators"
        FLAKY_RATE[Flakiness Rate]
        QUARANTINE_RATE[Quarantine Rate]
        STABILITY_TREND[Stability Trend]
        EFFECTIVENESS[Test Effectiveness]
    end
    
    subgraph "Improvement Actions"
        REMEDIATION[Test Remediation]
        REFACTORING[Test Refactoring]
        INFRASTRUCTURE[Infrastructure Fixes]
    end
    
    TOTAL --> FLAKY_RATE
    FLAKY --> FLAKY_RATE
    QUARANTINED --> QUARANTINE_RATE
    STABLE --> STABILITY_TREND
    
    FLAKY_RATE --> REMEDIATION
    QUARANTINE_RATE --> REFACTORING
    STABILITY_TREND --> INFRASTRUCTURE
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Flakiness Rate**: Percentage of tests identified as flaky
- **Quarantine Effectiveness**: Reduction in CI failures after quarantine
- **Test Stability Score**: Overall test suite reliability metric
- **Mean Time to Fix**: Average time to resolve flaky tests

### Business Impact Metrics

  AVG(build_duration_minutes) as avg_build_time,
  AVG(
    CASE 
      WHEN flaky_tests_quarantined > 0 
      THEN build_duration_minutes 
    END
  ) as avg_build_time_with_quarantine,
  (
    AVG(build_duration_minutes) - 
    AVG(
      CASE 
        WHEN flaky_tests_quarantined > 0 
        THEN build_duration_minutes 
      END
    )
  ) / AVG(build_duration_minutes) * 100 as improvement_percent
FROM ci_builds
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY repo_name;
```
