# .gitleaksignore - Fingerprint-based exceptions for Gitleaks
# This file contains specific fingerprints for one-time false positives
# Note: Most false positives should be handled via allowlist rules in .gitleaks.toml
# Only add fingerprints here as a temporary bridge for specific scan exceptions

# No current false-positive fingerprints identified
# Based on error-detective analysis, the repository has already resolved
# all known false positives through comprehensive allowlist configuration
# 
# Future fingerprints should be added in this format (one per line):
# fingerprint:hash_value_here
